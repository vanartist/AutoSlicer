AutoSlicer

    AutoSlicer is an automated pipeline for medical image processing,
    specifically designed for head and neck CT data.
    It performs DICOM-to-NIfTI conversion, organ segmentation using TotalSegmentator,
    skin label estimation, physical property computation (mass, volume, center of mass, inertia tensor),
    VTK mesh generation, and visualization,
    including transformation into the Frankfort anatomical coordinate system.

Features

    AutoSlicer provides the following core functionalities:
    DICOM → NIfTI conversion
    Whole-body segmentation using TotalSegmentator
    Skin segmentation using HU thresholds
    Mass, volume, center of mass, and inertia tensor calculation
    Coordinate transformation to Frankfort anatomical reference
    Head and neck separation
    VTK mesh generation and 3D visualization
    Advanced operations: label filtering, connected component analysis, planar cutting


Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Input
    A folder contains all the DICOM files. The workspace(final results folder name)should be assigned.
    For example:

    src\data
        1.dicom
        2.dicom
        ...
        500.dicom

Output

    JSON Output

    head_inertia_parameters_global_reference.json
    head_inertia_parameters_frankfort_reference.json
    neck_inertia_parameters_global_reference.json
    neck_inertia_parameters_frankfort_reference.json
    Each file contains:

    Volume (cm³)
    Mass (kg)
    Center of mass (in image, voxel, DICOM RAS, and Frankfort space)
    Inertia tensor in both mm² and cm²
    Principal moments and axes of inertia

    VTK Models
    head_visualization.vtk
    neck_visualization.vtk
    These can be loaded into software like 3D Slicer or ParaView.

    Coordinate System JSON

    PrincipalAxes_global_reference.mrk.json
    head_frankfort_reference.mrk.json
    neck_frankfort_reference.mrk.json
    These files define the anatomical coordinate axes in standard Slicer markup format.

Notes
    The default HU range for skin segmentation is estimated automatically from percentile thresholds, but can be overridden manually.
